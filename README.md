Prerequisites
=============

[Sphinx Documentation Generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/ "Sphinx 
Documentation Generator") must be installed to build the documentation. 
Please note that easy_install is a component of Python's Setup Tools 
package, which is commonly an optional install on most distributions.


To get started, you need to install all necesasary tools:
    
    sudo apt-get install git python-pip python-dev make imagemagick libjpeg-dev inkscape

Among other things that installs
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/ "ImageMagick") and
[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/ "Inkscape").

And Sphinx necessary extensions:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

In addition to these eggs you will need to install 
[PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/ "PlantUML")

To install PlantUML run this wget process:

    sudo wget \
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download \
    -O /sbin/plantuml.jar

PlantumUML requires java:
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

We use [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/ "Inkscape") to edit SVG images
and convert them to PDF but you may use any other SVG-capable tool you
like. We're not picky.

Building
========

To build a guide in HTML format, go to its directory and then run the 
``make`` command in that directory, like so:

    make html

To generate the PDF file run this:

    make pdf

You will find generated HTML documentation at:

    _build/html
    
You will find generated PDF documentation at:

	_build/pdf


To generate the Release Rotes PDF file run this:

    make rnpdf

You will find generated Release Notes PDF at:

    _build/pdf
